					Gypsum Based Fireproofing
				%p
					The gypsum based cementitious fireproofing product is fire resistive material for structural steel framed construction. This material is a dry, fire resistive material that when mixed with water forms a slurry mix that is then spray-applied to the substrate allowing for application that follows the contours of the substrate. The product is applied to interior or exterior steel structures, but is not recommended for long-term exposure to weather. The gypsum based fireproofing product can be applied together with an Accelerator to ensure that set time and product yield is lower for lower installation costs.
